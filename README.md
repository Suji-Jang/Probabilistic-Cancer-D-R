# Probabilistic-Cancer-D-R

Source file of "Beyond the Cancer Slope Factor: Broad Application of Bayesian and Probabilistic Approaches for Cancer Dose-Response Assessment". The “BMD-data” folder includes all the data used for the analysis and outputs of MCMC simulations after a Bayesian analysis.  The “codes” folder includes all the codes for obtaining Bayesian BMD, RSD, and HDMI and reproducing the figures in the paper. The “figures” folder includes all the figures produced by the codes. The “function” folder includes the function codes for BMD modeling and risk estimations. The “results” folder mainly includes the RSD and HDMI results and the sampled dose-response data. “Vignette.Rmd” can provide an example of the analysis using “ExampleBWdata.csv” and “ExampleBioassayData.csv”.
